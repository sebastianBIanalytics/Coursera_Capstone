    "Having a stable population of 8.6 million people and a daytime population of over 10 million people (__[London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/daytime-population-borough)__), London is the biggest city in Europe. London has a relatively young population, of people who mainly come here to study and work. London is extremelly diverse from cultural and ethnic point of view has a strong hospitality sector consisting mainly in restaurant, hotels, pubs, bars and coffee shops. \n",
    "Especially pubs are extremelly popular in London as they represent an important socialising place for Londoners and tourists. \n",
    "According to *2016 Pub Audit*, there were **3615** pubs in London a decline from 4835 pubs back in 2001 (__[Estate agent London News](https://www.greaterlondonproperties.co.uk/how-many-pubs-in-london/)__ , 2018). Although many pubs might closed their doors due to high rents and taxes and strong competitive environment, another important factor can be the change in consumer behaviour as a considerable segment of consumers prefer to switch from drinking beer which is the dominant product sold in pubs to drinnking wines which tends to be bought for domestic consumption but also consumed in wine bars. As millenials seem to be spend more money on good quality wines, opening a chain of wine bars in London can potentially answer to an increasing need to educate consumers in this direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Socio-demographic profile of wine consumers\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a study proposed by __[Duke University](https://sites.duke.edu/sociol342d_001_s2014_wine/global-value-chains/types-of-consumers/)__  (2014) wine consumers can overall be classified as \n",
    "**overwhelmed (23%)** by the available choices on store shelves, **Image Seekers (20%)** who use wine as a symbol of status, **traditionalists (16%)** who have clear established preferences, the **Savy Shoppers (16%)** who \"enjoy shopping for wine and discovering new varietal s on their own\", **Satisfied Sippers (14%)** who simply like to drink and **wine enthusiasts (12%)** who \"consider themselves knowledgeable about wine\". Although this study was not performed in London, it is reasonable to assume the profiles can easily fit London wine market. \n"
